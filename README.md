<h1>TOEDOE APP</h1>

This project is a web application developed using Vue.js 3 for efficiently storing and managing users and their associated tasks. The application was built as part of the Udemy course "Fullstack Laravel 10 + Vue.js 3 (2023) - Build APIs and SPAs." Through this course, I gained hands-on experience with the foundational concepts of Vue 3, including:

- Components: Creating reusable UI elements that encapsulate their own logic and structure.
- Reactive Data Binding: Implementing reactive data that automatically updates the UI when the state changes.
- Computed Properties: Using computed properties to derive and display dynamic content based on reactive state.
- Event Handling: Managing user interactions and triggering updates within the application.
- Composition API: Organizing and structuring code more efficiently by using the Composition API to group related logic.
- Vue Router: Implementing navigation and routing to manage different views within the application.

This project showcases the practical application of these core Vue 3 concepts, providing a solid foundation for building dynamic and interactive web applications.
